# IRIS

The Iris flower dataset is a multivariate dataset.
The dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

DATA VISUALIZATION IS DONE BY USING IRIS DATASET

WE CAN ANALYAZE FROM THE HISTOGRAM THAT:
- The highest frequency of the sepal length is around 25 which is between 5.5 and 6.5
- The highest frequency of the sepal Width is between 30 to 35 which is between 3.0 and 3.5
- The highest frequency of the petal length is around 35 which is between 1 and 2
- The highest frequency of the petal width is around 40 which is between 0.0 and 0.5


WE CAN ANALYAZE FROM HEATMAP THAT:
- 1 Petal width and petal length have high correlations.
- 2 Petal length and sepal width have good correlations.
- 3 Petal Width and Sepal length have good correlations.
